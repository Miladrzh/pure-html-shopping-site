# Pure HTML shopping site
###### Tags: HTML, CSS
###### Clean Code Status: Need to refactor .css files to CSS best practices
This repo is one of my Web Development course homework. In this homework we had to implement a shopping site client-side from scratch and we didnt allowed to use any JS framework, or frameworks like bootstrap and semantic UI react.


The project has deployed to Github-Pages and you can see how it looks like by clicking [here](https://myieproject.github.io//).
